### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is David CARAYON and I'm a statistician at the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and the Environment (INRAE).

My work mainly focuses on **environmental evaluation**. I build evaluation methods based on composite and statistically relevant indicators and also develop tools and software associated with these methods.

I use R about 90% of my working time from statistical analysis to package and shiny app development.

I also like to contribute to coding challenges such as the #Tidytuesday weekly R dataviz challenge.
