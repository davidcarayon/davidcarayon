### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is David Carayon and I'm a statistician at the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and the Environment (INRAE).

My work mainly focuses on **environmental evaluation**. I build evaluation methods based on composite and statistically relevant indicators and also develop tools and software associated with these methods.

My main programming langages/skill are R (advanced), LaTeX, SQL and Python.

I also like to contribute to coding challenges such as the #Tidytuesday weekly R dataviz challenge.
