### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is David Carayon and I'm a statistician / Data Analyst at the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and the Environment (INRAE).

My work mainly focuses on **environmental evaluation**. I build evaluation methods based on composite and statistically relevant indicators and also develop tools and software associated with these methods. 

My main programming langages/skills are R (tidyverse, tidymodels, shiny), Quarto/Rmarkdown, SQL and Python.
